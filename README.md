# Stroke Prediction Project

In this repository, you'll find the code and analysis for a machine learning project focused on predicting strokes using multiple models.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Predict strokes based on health-related features.
- **Dataset**: Includes age, gender, hypertension and more.
- **Methods**: Supervised learning, oversampling, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Explore and visualize dataset characteristics.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handle class imbalance, outliers, and missing data.
3. **Modeling**: Train various models, including SVM and Random Forest.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters using Optuna.

## Repository Structure

- **data**: Contains the dataset for training and testing.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step exploration.
- **images**: Visualizations and plots from the analysis.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required libraries for the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the Jupyter notebook for the project.
